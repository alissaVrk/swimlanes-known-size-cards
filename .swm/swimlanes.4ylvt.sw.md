## Introduction

this is the component - `Swimlanes`<swm-token data-swm-token=":src/swimlanes/Swimlanes.tsx:13:4:4:`export function Swimlanes() {`"/> but it doesn't add it, which is very annoying!!

let try this `Swimlanes`<swm-token data-swm-token=":src/swimlanes/Swimlanes.tsx:13:4:4:`export function Swimlanes() {`"/>

snippet works, but I don't want a snippet

29         scrollToFn: (offset, options, instance) => {
